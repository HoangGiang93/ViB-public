<h1> Welcome to the fifth day of our hands-on course!</h1>
Today, you will focus on the critical aspect of logging and analyzing the robot's actions during the milk delivery task. This knowledge will help you identify areas for improvement and optimize future robotic tasks.

**Goal**: By the end of the session, you will be able to set up logging to capture execution data and analyze this data to enhance task performance.

## Prerequisites
- ?

## Theoretical Background
- We will discuss logging frameworks and how they capture important execution data.
- You’ll learn how analysis of logs can reveal inefficiencies and inform better planning algorithms.

## Step-by-Step Hands-On Exercises
1. **Set Up Logging**: Configure logging to capture the robot's actions during the milk delivery task.
2. **Analyze Logs**: Examine the collected logs to identify any inefficiencies or issues during task execution.
3. **Discussion**: Discuss how the insights gained from log analysis can lead to improvements in robotic planning and execution.
4. **Code Examples**: Work with scripts for logging and analyzing critical data points.
