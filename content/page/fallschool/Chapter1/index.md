In Chapter 1, you will learn to create a simulation environment using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF). 
You’ll set up a basic URDF model that includes essential objects like a fridge and a table, and visualize it. 
This foundational knowledge will enable you to understand how robots interact with their surroundings.

 <h1> Welcome to the first day of our hands-on course!</h1>
Today, you'll learn how to create a simulation environment using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format). URDF is essential because it helps define the structure, shape, and physical properties of objects, allowing robots to interact with them accurately in a simulated environment.
 
**Goal**: By the end of the session, you will have created a simple URDF model that includes essential objects like a fridge, a table, and other items, and visualized this setup in Gazebo.

## Prerequisites
- ??
- ??

## Theoretical Background
- We'll start with a brief introduction to URDF and explain how meshes are used to represent objects in a simulation.
- You’ll learn how different objects are linked and why defining their visual and collision properties is crucial for realistic interaction.

## Step-by-Step Hands-On Exercises
1. **Create a Basic URDF File Structure**: Start by setting up the fundamental structure of a URDF file.
2. **Add Models for Objects**: Integrate models for the fridge, table, and other essential items into your URDF.
3. **Integrate with Gazebo**: Use Gazebo to visualize and test your environment setup.

Throughout the exercises, we will provide code examples to demonstrate how to define links, joints, and meshes effectively.

## Further Reading/Exercises
- For those interested in exploring more, we’ll provide links to additional ROS URDF tutorials and Gazebo documentation.
- **Challenge**: Try adding a new object, like a cup, to your environment and adjust its position to fit the scene. This will help reinforce your understanding of how to modify URDF files.
