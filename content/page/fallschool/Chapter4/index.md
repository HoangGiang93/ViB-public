<h1> Welcome to the fourth day of our hands-on course!</h1>
Today, you will focus on executing the complete task of transporting milk from the fridge to the table. This session will integrate all the knowledge and skills you've developed so far.

**Goal**: By the end of the session, you will have successfully completed the full milk delivery task, demonstrating how to combine perception, planning, and knowledge retrieval.

## Prerequisites
- ?

## Theoretical Background
- We will recap all components involved in the task: URDF, perception, planning, and knowledge base utilization.
- You will learn about common simulation gaps and limitations that may arise during task execution.

## Step-by-Step Hands-On Exercises
1. **Create a Task Plan**: Develop a comprehensive plan that incorporates all previous learnings.
2. **Simulate the Full Task**: Execute the task by opening the fridge, perceiving the milk, picking it up, and placing it on the table.
3. **Code Examples**: You will work with a complete script that combines all sub-tasks into one cohesive execution.
